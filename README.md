aws-scripts
===========

Here you will find some useful AWS scripts I use from time to time.

All the scripts relies on [Boto](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforpython/), a Python package that provides interfaces to Amazon Web Services.

So, to use these scripts, you need to install Boto and provide your AWS credentinals:

To install aws-scripts and all the required Python packages just type:

```
pip install aws-scripts 
```

If dependencies are already satisfied, nothing will be installed.

If you already have aws-scripts installed in your computer you can update to the latest version as follows:

```
pip install --upgrade aws-scripts
```

To provide your AWS credentials use the boto/boto3 config file `~/.aws/credentials`:

``` ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX>
aws_secret_access_key = <xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx>
region=xx-xxxx-x
```

> Note that you can use the environment variable: ```AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=xx-xxxx-x``` to override the default region on the config file.
> In the ec2-instances.py script you can also use the ```--region``` option for the same purpose 

ec2-instances.py
----------------

Lists the EC2 instances including the Name Tag, IP, type, zone, vpc, subnet and the status.

You can filter the result by name, type and/or status. Or you can provide a list of instance IDs instead.

Finally you can execute remote commands on all the instances returned by the filter or the list.

The execution method support both: direct connections against the public instance IP or using a bastion host.

When this method is used, the .ssh/config file is used to establish the connection.

![Demo](https://github.com/frommelmak/aws-scripts/raw/master/img/demo.png)

The '-h' option shows you how to use the available options.

```
usage: ec2-instances.py [-h] [-n NAME] [-t TYPE] [-s STATUS] [--public_ip PUBLIC_IP] [--private_ip PRIVATE_IP] [-l ID_LIST [ID_LIST ...]] [-i IGNORE] [-e EXECUTE] [-r REGION] [-u USER]
                        [-c {direct,bastion-host}]

Shows a list with your EC2 instances, then you can execute remote commands on those instances.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n NAME, --name NAME  Filter result by name.
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE  Filer result by type.
  -s STATUS, --status STATUS
                        Filter result by status.
  --public_ip PUBLIC_IP
                        Filter result by public ip address. You can provide the whole IP address string or just a portion of it.
  --private_ip PRIVATE_IP
                        Filter result by private ip adreess. You can provide the whole IP address string or just a portion of it.
  -l ID_LIST [ID_LIST ...], --id_list ID_LIST [ID_LIST ...]
                        Do not filter the result. Provide a InstanceIds list instead.
  -i IGNORE, --ignore IGNORE
                        Do not show hosts lines containing the "IGNORE" pattern in the tag Name
  -e EXECUTE, --execute EXECUTE
                        Execute a command on instances
  -r REGION, --region REGION
                        Specify an alternate region to override the one defined in the .aws/credentials file
  -u USER, --user USER  User to run commands (if -e option is used). A user is always required, even if you have one defined in .ssh/config file
  -c {direct,bastion-host}, --connection_method {direct,bastion-host}
                        The Method to connect to the instance (if -e option is used). If the instance exposes the SSH port on a public IP, use direct. Otherwhise choose bastion-host. This method look for
                        the hostname and username inside the .ssh/config file to reach the target instance.

```

ec2-reserved.py
----------------

Lists details of all your Instance Reservations, including a summary of the active reservations by type and size.

The summary also shows your reserved active capacity after apply the normalization factor. This is useful to compare the reserved capacity with the deployed in production.

You can also use the option `--create-google-calendar-events` to add the expiration date of the active reservations in your Google Calendar Account.

```
usage: ec2-reserved.py [-h]
                        [-s {payment-pending,active,payment-failed,retired}]
                        [--create-google-calendar-events] [-t TYPE]

Show reserved EC2 instances

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s {payment-pending,active,payment-failed,retired}, --state {payment-pending,active,payment-failed,retired}
                        Filer result by reservation state.
  --create-google-calendar-events
                        Create events in your Google Calendar, using the
                        expiration dates of your active reservations
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE  Filer result by instance type.
```

To use the Google calendar feature you just have to [enable the calendar API in your Google Account](https://console.developers.google.com) and create a calendar called aws in the [Google Calendar](http://calendar.google.com/). Then create the *OAuth client ID* credentials. Download the credentials file and save it as `client_secret.json` in the aws-scripts folder repo. When you run the script using the `--create-google-calendar-events` option for the first time, a web browser will be opened asking your to login with the Google account you want to use.

Then, whenever you buy new reservations on Amazon Web Services, you can add the new reservations in your calendar by just running the script.


ec2-instance-state.py
---------------------
Set the desired state for an EC2 instance or a list of instances.

You can use it form a cron task in order to manage the instance state of one or several instances.
You can even use it without providing the IAM user credentials, thanks to the assume role support.

The '-h' optipn shows you how to use the available options.

```
usage: ec2-instance-state.py [-h] [-s {stop,start,reboot,terminate}] -l ID_LIST [ID_LIST ...] [--role_arn ROLE_ARN] [-r REGION]

Set desired EC2 instance state

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s {stop,start,reboot,terminate}, --state {stop,start,reboot,terminate}
                        Set the desired state for the instances provided
  -l ID_LIST [ID_LIST ...], --id_list ID_LIST [ID_LIST ...]
                        InstanceIds list
  --role_arn ROLE_ARN   If the script run on an EC2 instance with an IAM role attached, then the Security Token Service will provide a set of temporary credentials allowing the actions of the assumed role.
                        With this method, no user credentials are required, just the Role ARN to be assumed.
  -r REGION, --region REGION
                        Specify an alternate region to override the one defined in the .aws/credentials file
```

This is an example of the minimun permissions required in the Role Policy in order to auto-stop an instance from a cron job.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {

```

ec2-sg.py
---------

Lists the EC2 Security Groups within an AWS region. The result can be filtered by name.
You can also show the Inbound and Outbound rules of the chosen security group.

As a sysadmin and/or developer, you or your team mates, will probably find yourself updating your public IP address frequently in order to gain SSH access to your EC2 instances.

This command help you to do so. Just use the argument `--allow_my_public_ip` providing the Security Group ID and the Security Group Rule ID you want to update. The command will find out your public IP and will update the rule allowing you the SSH access.

```
usage: ec2-sg.py [-h] [-n NAME] [-l GID_LIST [GID_LIST ...]] [-r REGION] [-s SHOW] [--allow_my_public_ip ALLOW_MY_PUBLIC_IP] [--security_group_rule_id SECURITY_GROUP_RULE_ID] [--description DESCRIPTION]

                        It shows the current generation of ELBs (Application, Network and/or Gateway) and/or the previous one (Classic).
```

ec2-snap-mgmt.py
----------------

With this script you can see the relationships between your snapshots and your EBS volumes and AMIs. This allows you to choose the snapshots you don't need to keep in the AWS S3 service.

By default the script shows all the volumes and AMIs related to each snapshost.

You you can also show all the snapshots related with each volume. This option is specially usefull when you only want to keep a certain number of snapshots per volume.

Finally, you can show all the snapshots related with each AMI.

The '-h' option shows you how to use the available options.

```
usage: ec2-snap-mgmt.py [-h] [-v {orphan,volumes}] owner_id

positional arguments:
  owner_id              12-digit AWS Account Number

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v {orphan,volumes,images}, --view {orphan,volumes,images}
                        Available views: orphan and volumes. Orphan is the
                        default one.
```

The script doesn't delete anything actually, just shows you the relationship in a tree view.

mongodb-backup.py
-----------------

This is a tool to make MongoDB backups on Amazon.

Two methods are supported: dump and snapshot.

- For the first one It uses `mongodump` to perform a binary backup of your local or remote MongoDB instance. The dumped files are compressed in a tarball file and uploaded to a Amazon S3 bucket.
- For the snapshot method, you can provide the data and / or the journal volumes and the script automatically will lock the database and will suspend all the writes during the backup process to ensure the consistency of the backup if required.

For the dump method, you can specify the number of copies to retain in the bucket or in the EC2 snapshot area. The oldest ones will be automatically removed.

```
usage: mongodb-backup.py [-h] [-m {dump,snapshot}] [-u USER] [-p PASSWORD] [-H HOST] [-d DATABASE] [-c COLLECTION] [-e EXCLUDE_COLLECTION] [-o OUT] [-n NUMBER] [-b BUCKET] [-P PREFIX]

route53-set-hostname.py
-----------------------

This script allows you to automatically set predictable DNS records for instances launched using AWS Auto Scaling. 

It is intended to be executed from the ec2 instance at launch time.
The script looks for an available name matching the provided pattern in the DNS zone. Then, it adds this name as a CNAME record in the DNS zone pointing to the EC2 instance public name.

```
usage: route53-set-hostname.py [-h] --HostedZoneId HOSTEDZONEID --HostStr

------------------------

As its own name says, this worker is designed to use auto scaling [lifecycle hooks](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html).

The process looks for incoming messages into the SQS queue associated with the autoscaling group. Then, when a message comes for the instance, it is consumed and the associated custom action is triggered. Finally, using the lifecycle action token, the worker completes the autoscaling action going on with the launch or ending the instance action.

```
